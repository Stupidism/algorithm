### Question 4

> Please tell us about your personal and professional values. (Go into as much or as little detail as you’d like, but try to limit it to 500 words; less is also fine!) Thanks in advance for inviting us into your world, head, and heart! *

**Personal Value**:
My personal value is deeply rooted in the philosophy of "Universal Love and Non-Aggression," which finds its central tenets in the teachings of Mozi. "Universal Love" (兼爱) emphasizes selfless love and peace, encouraging us to show love and compassion to all individuals equally, whether they are family members or strangers on the street. "Non-Aggression" (非攻) means refraining from violent or aggressive actions driven by selfish motives. It's important to note that "Non-Aggression" doesn't equate to a complete rejection of self-defense; we retain the right to protect ourselves or support the vulnerable when faced with aggression from others.

I appreciate and resonate with the principles of open-source software development because they align with the concept of "Universal Love." Open source embodies the spirit of individuals sharing their creations with the world, free of charge, out of a genuine love for their craft and a desire to contribute to the greater good. This resonates with the idea of universal love, where we extend our compassion and generosity to all, irrespective of boundaries or barriers.

**Professional Value**:
In my professional life, I draw inspiration from the Taoist philosophy that "Great wisdom looks stupid, and great skill seems clumsy." This concept underlines the idea that true wisdom and skill are not about grand displays or unnecessary complexity. Instead, they manifest in simplicity, humility, and the ability to perform tasks with grace and ease.

Furthermore, I find parallels between my professional values and the simplicity and modularity found in products like Lego, React, Next.js and Payload CMS. These technologies excel in allowing components to seamlessly stack together, promoting efficiency and ease of use. I admire this approach as it embodies the Taoist principle of great skill appearing clumsy – where the end result may seem straightforward but is underpinned by a depth of skill and understanding.

In summary, my personal and professional values are grounded in the principles of universal love, non-aggression, and the pursuit of wisdom and skill through simplicity and humility. These values guide my actions, decisions, and contributions both in my personal life and in my professional endeavors.


### Question 5

> Please share a time when you realized that you might be wrong about something. What was the outcome? What did you learn? (Please use a professional example, if you have one.) *

Reflecting on a professional example, there was a significant instance in which I had to acknowledge my initial error and adapt to a changing situation.

In my previous role with the team, we were using a markdown-based, self-developed CMS to manage our organic web pages. Drawing from my previous experience with Contentful, I believed that migrating to Contentful could enhance our content management capabilities, so I proposed and eventually executed the migration. Initially, the results were promising; we gained access to numerous useful features. However, several months down the line, as our content repository grew to over 50,000 records, a significant issue emerged. The high cost associated with Contentful began to strain our budget, forcing us to find workarounds every two weeks to stay within our allotted quota.

It was during this challenging period that I had to confront the reality of my decision. I recognized that I had made a suboptimal technical choice that was now threatening our financial sustainability. It became evident that continuing with Contentful might result in substantial ongoing expenses.

In response, I took it upon myself to thoroughly investigate more cost-effective headless CMS options and self-hosted solutions. This research led me to discover payloadCMS, which seemed to align better with our needs in terms of affordability and functionality. I proposed migrating to payloadCMS and, thanks to the structured data from our prior migration, the transition was seamless and successful.

This experience taught me several valuable lessons:

1. **Consider Scalability:** When conducting technical investigations and making decisions, it's crucial to factor in potential scalability issues. What might work well for a smaller dataset may not be suitable as the organization grows.

2. **Admitting Mistakes:** Acknowledging and taking responsibility for a suboptimal decision is essential. It's not about avoiding mistakes but about being willing to address and rectify them.

3. **Learning and Improvement:** Mistakes can serve as valuable learning experiences. In this case, the prior migration to Contentful provided us with structured data, which proved advantageous during the subsequent migration. It highlighted the potential for turning setbacks into opportunities for improvement.

Ultimately, this experience reinforced the importance of adaptability and continuous learning in the ever-evolving landscape of technology and decision-making.

I'm genuinely passionate about the art of transformation, which extends from optimizing everyday objects to enhancing digital processes.

In my daily life, I find immense joy in reimagining and enhancing the functionality of objects we often take for granted. Whether it's something as simple as reorganizing the layout of my home, optimizing water pipes under the sink, or even changing a light fixture, I become a kind of handyman, transforming my surroundings for a better experience. This passion also extends to the digital realm, where I've encouraged those around me, such as my spouse, to embrace cloud-based document services after they encountered issues syncing files with external drives and network-attached storage.

In a professional context, my passion for transformation is evident when I work on code. When I'm involved in a project, I can't help but seek opportunities to optimize and refine the codebase. I often find myself optimizing the code written by other engineers in the same files I'm working on, through practices like code linting or refactoring according to best practices. This drive for improvement, however, is not without its challenges. Occasionally, these "unnecessary" changes have led to unexpected bugs, but the satisfaction I derive from these refactors and optimizations keeps me motivated to push for excellence.

In essence, my passion for transformation, whether in daily life or in the professional sphere, centers around the belief that there's always room for improvement, and I find immense fulfillment in the process of making things better and more efficient.
